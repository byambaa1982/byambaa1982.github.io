Subtitle: Exploring Naval’s Wisdom on Building Wealth and Success

In a series of thought-provoking tweets, Naval, an entrepreneur, and twitter account, shares his insights on building wealth and success. In this blog post, we will dissect his ideas and explore the concept of specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.

## The Power of Specific Knowledge:
Specific knowledge is unique expertise that cannot be easily replicated or outsourced. It is often derived from a person’s genuine curiosity and passion. This type of knowledge is not taught in schools but rather through apprenticeships, allowing individuals to develop highly technical or creative skills. J.K. Rowling, the renowned author of the Harry Potter series, is a perfect example of someone with specific knowledge. She combined her passion for writing and her love for fantasy to create an extraordinary story that resonated with millions of people worldwide. Her specific knowledge of storytelling and the magical world she created made her an irreplaceable asset in the literary field. By building specific knowledge, you create a unique value proposition that sets you apart from the competition.

## 2. Embracing Accountability:

Accountability is the key to earning society’s trust and gaining leverage. Naval emphasizes the importance of taking business risks under your own name, as those who are most accountable have singular, public, and risky brands, such as Oprah, Trump, Kanye, and Elon Musk.

## 3. Leverage: The Key to Building Fortunes:

Naval identifies three types of leverage: capital, labor, and permissionless leverage (code and media).

- Capital: Money allows you to use leverage in the form of investments, but it requires specific knowledge, accountability, and good judgment to attract and manage capital.
- Labor: Employing people to work for you is a traditional form of leverage but is not as efficient as permissionless leverage.
- Code and Media: The most powerful form of leverage, code and media, allows you to create products and content that work for you while you sleep. They are permissionless because you do not need anyone’s approval to create and distribute them.

## 4. Building Judgement:

Judgment is a critical skill that can be cultivated through experience and the development of foundational skills. Naval suggests that there is no specific skill called “business” and advises against business magazines and classes. Instead, focus on learning the foundational skills that will improve your decision-making abilities. Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has demonstrated exceptional judgment throughout his career. He honed his skills by studying the teachings of Benjamin Graham and focused on understanding the intrinsic value of companies. His consistent emphasis on long-term value creation and the importance of ethical management has made him one of the most successful investors in history.
