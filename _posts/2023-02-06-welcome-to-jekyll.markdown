Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live in a world without the distractions and excess of modern society? I had the privilege of experiencing just that during my childhood growing up in the small village of Khishis-Undur in Mongolia.

Despite the lack of restaurants, internet, and modern heating and plumbing systems, I have nothing but fond memories of my upbringing. My childhood was filled with endless outdoor playtime with friends, even in the harshest of Mongolian winters. Sledding down hills, skiing on the frozen terrain, and engaging in friendly snowball fights were just a few of the winter activities that filled my days. Summer was even more magical, as I spent my days horseback riding, racing, and swimming in the nearby rivers. The diversity of outdoor activities available to me in Mongolia provided an unparalleled childhood experience.

But my experience in Mongolia wasn't just about the outdoor adventures. I was also surrounded by a close-knit community who, despite limited financial resources and few material possessions, lived life at a slower pace. The people of my homeland were not burdened by the stress of competition or the need to constantly hustle and hurry. Instead, they took each day as it came and cherished the simple joys of life. This relaxed and contented way of life had a profound impact on me, and I strive to incorporate these values into my own life as I navigate the fast-paced world around me.

Looking back on my childhood in Mongolia, I am filled with gratitude for the experiences and lessons it provided me. My time there taught me the importance of living in the present moment, cherishing relationships, and appreciating the simple joys of life. I am thankful for the memories and the values that have shaped who I am today.

I hope that my story of growing up in Mongolia will inspire others to reflect on the meaningful experiences and values that have shaped their own lives.
