It was a fateful day when I met Selengue, now fondly known as "Tso Teacher" by her students, and that encounter changed my life forever. As a young and nervous teacher starting my first day at school, I was eager to meet the new addition to our faculty. The other teachers were buzzing with excitement about Selengue, and I couldn't wait to introduce myself.

The moment I met her, I was struck by her warm smile and sparkling eyes. Little did I know, this chance encounter would start a journey that would change my life forever. A few days later, the school principal invited all teachers to his new home for an ice-breaking party. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend, but fate intervened when the principal later invited Selengue and me to a private gathering on September 3rd, 2003.

That day, Selengue shared her incredible story of perseverance and determination, growing up in a country undergoing political and economic turmoil. Despite the lack of resources, she was relentless in her pursuit of knowledge, driven by a passion to learn and connect with the world beyond her country's borders. Her story touched me deeply and inspired me to pursue my own dreams.

With Selengue's support and encouragement, I decided to learn English, a challenge for a physics teacher like myself. Her unwavering support saw me through the struggles of learning a new language, and my hard work paid off when I was selected for the prestigious Japanese Government Scholarship. In 2009, I traveled to Japan to study physics at Miyagi University of Education in Sendai, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that would not have been possible without Selengue's support.

In addition to her unwavering support and encouragement, Selengue was a truly unique and fascinating person. She had a passion for coffee and could often be found enjoying a cup, savoring its rich flavor. She was also a proud pet owner of a white dog named Tsoonoo, who brought her joy and companionship. Beyond her love for coffee and her furry friend, Selengue was also an athletic woman, who excelled in sports like basketball and volleyball. She was always up for a good challenge, and her competitive spirit only added to her charm and zest for life.

Her combination of intelligence, determination, and infectious personality made her one of the most well-loved teachers at the school, and her students adored her for her kindness and infectious enthusiasm for learning. She truly left a lasting impact on everyone she met, and I feel so grateful to have had the chance to cross paths with her.

Looking back on that fateful day, I am reminded of the power of human connections and the incredible impact that one person can have on another's life. Selengue's story of perseverance and determination continues to inspire me to pursue my dreams, and her unwavering support and encouragement will forever be ingrained in my memory. I am grateful for the opportunity to have known her, and I hope to honor her memory by following in her footsteps and continuing to pursue my passion for learning and connecting with the world beyond my own borders.
