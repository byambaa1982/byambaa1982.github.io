We began our adventure from Chicago on a Saturday morning. To make the most of our budget, we secured an Airbnb from Monday through Friday, taking advantage of the more affordable weekday rates. This decision led us to embrace the beauty of the outdoors, opting to camp over the weekend.

After a 5-hour drive, we found ourselves near Cincinnati, Ohio. There, we visited a farm and purchased a sheep. Respecting tradition, we had the sheep prepared for us, and that evening, we savored its inner organs cooked in a traditional Mongolian style. It was a delightful culinary experience, capturing the essence of our adventurous spirit.

On the morning of our second day, we were excited to explore the "Natural Bridge" National Park in Kentucky, with the Under Gorge kayak trip as a particular highlight we eagerly anticipated. Due to a weak GPS signal, our group unintentionally got divided: one car was directed to the visitor center, while the other ended up at the sky lift location. Close to the sky lift parking area, one of our members unfortunately had her purse taken from her car during a brief restroom stop. A word of caution to travelers in the area: always be vigilant with your personal belongings. Nevertheless, our camping site was tranquil and not too busy, providing a calming respite from the day's challenges. 

On Monday, we had a clear plan in place. Our first agenda was to take the $22-per-person sky lift ride, which would give us a stunning view of the natural bridge from the mountain's peak. After that, we intended to secure tickets for the Under Gorge kayak trip. Once all was settled, we would embark on a 5-hour drive to our Airbnb, situated near the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee. We marveled at the unique rock formations and took several memorable photos. Later, we headed to the Under Gorge kayak spot to buy our tickets. Much to our dismay, we learned that they were fully booked for the entire week. It seems we should have reserved our spots a few weeks in advance. But we weren’t disheartened. Instead, we shifted our excitement to the next part of our journey and headed to our aptly named "Million Dollar View" Airbnb home, ready for the next chapter of our adventure.


Navigating the narrow mountain roads was quite a challenge for me. Recognizing that my friend had superior driving skills, we decided to switch places. Even with the intricate mountain routes and the task of locating the house, the check-in process was seamless, a testament to our host's experience. The house itself was vast, and the view it offered was nothing short of spectacular. The children's excitement was palpable, adding to the thrill of our adventure. Additionally, we had unexpected visitors: a bear accompanied by three cubs made their way to the house. Likely drawn by the aroma of our barbecue, their presence was a tad intimidating yet undeniably added an adventurous twist to our experience.


On Tuesday, we began our Smoky Mountain journey with a trip to Clingmans Dome, one of the highest points in Eastern America. The elevated vantage point provided breathtaking panoramic views of the mist-enshrouded mountains. As we stood atop its iconic observation tower, it felt like we were touching the sky, truly experiencing the grandeur that the East has to offer. This majestic start set the tone for our continued exploration.Following our time at Clingmans Dome, we ventured to Gatlinburg to sample the local wines and whiskies. This was a novel experience for us, allowing us to immerse ourselves in the rich flavors and traditions of the region. The tastings not only introduced us to new flavors but also deepened our appreciation for Gatlinburg's vibrant culinary scene.

On Wednesday, considering the diverse interests of our group of five families and varying ages of the kids, we chose to divide and conquer. Some of us, accompanied by the teenagers, sought the thrill of ziplining. Meanwhile, the other group ventured to Gatlinburg to experience the allure of the longest pedestrian skybridge, complemented by the skylift, skydeck, and its captivating skytrail. This approach ensured everyone had a day tailored to their interests and energy levels.

On thursday a rainy day, we had to seek some in door activity and accidentally discoverd the Tuckeleechee cavern. It wasn't our plan, however, it iOn Thursday, the rain made its presence known, urging us to explore indoor activities. That's when we serendipitously stumbled upon the Tuckaleechee Caverns. This unexpected find became, for me, the most wondrous highlight of our Smoky Mountain trip. Instead of embarking on a long trail, we conveniently drove up to the entrance, purchased tickets for around $20, and were soon led into the cave by an experienced guide.

The tour, lasting about an hour and a half, was awe-inspiring. Tuckaleechee Caverns, situated in Townsend, TN, and often hailed as the “Greatest Site Under the Smokies,” boasts the highest rating for any cave or cavern in the Eastern United States. Its breathtaking underground waterfall plummets a staggering 210 feet, earning it the distinction of being the tallest subterranean waterfall in the Eastern US. The 1.25-mile round trip journey presented us with millions of intricate formations, further solidifying the caverns as a must-visit gem of the region.

On Friday, it was time to bid farewell to our Smoky Mountain retreat. We checked out of our accommodations and began our journey back home, carrying with us a trove of cherished memories.
