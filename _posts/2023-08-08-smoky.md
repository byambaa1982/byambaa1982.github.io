We started our trip from Chicago on a Saturday. To save money, we booked an Airbnb from Monday to Friday because it was cheaper during the week. So, we decided to camp during the weekend.

After driving for 5 hours, we reached near Cincinnati, Ohio. We went to a farm there and bought a sheep. They prepared the sheep for us, and we ate its parts that evening, cooked in a special way from Mongolia. It tasted very good and was a new experience for us.

The next day, we wanted to see the “Natural Bridge” Park in Kentucky. We were looking forward to a kayak trip there. But our group got split up because of a bad GPS signal: one car went to the visitor center and the other to the sky lift. Near the sky lift, someone took a purse from one of our cars when we stopped for a bathroom break. We called the police and filed a report, which took about 2 to 3 hours. So, be careful with your things if you visit. But, our camping spot was quiet and peaceful, which was nice after our busy day.

On Monday, we had a clear plan in place. First on our agenda was the $22-per-person sky lift ride, promising a breathtaking view of the natural bridge from the mountain's peak. Following that, we aimed to purchase tickets for the Under Gorge kayak trip. With everything organized, we would then commence our 5-hour drive to our Airbnb near the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee. We were awed by the unique rock formations and captured several memorable photos. Later, when we approached the Under Gorge kayak station to buy tickets, we were disappointed to find out they were sold out for the entire week. It appears we should've booked our spots weeks earlier. However, we remained optimistic. We channeled our enthusiasm towards the next leg of our journey and made our way to our "Million Dollar View" Airbnb, eagerly anticipating the upcoming adventures.

Navigating the narrow mountain roads was quite a challenge for me. Recognizing that my friend had superior driving skills, we decided to switch places. Even with the intricate mountain routes and the task of locating the house, the check-in process was seamless, a testament to our host's experience. The house itself was vast, and the view it offered was nothing short of spectacular. The children's excitement was palpable, adding to the thrill of our adventure. Additionally, we had unexpected visitors: a bear accompanied by three cubs made their way to the house. Likely drawn by the aroma of our barbecue, their presence was a tad intimidating yet undeniably added an adventurous twist to our experience.

On Tuesday, we began our Smoky Mountain journey with a trip to Clingmans Dome, one of the highest points in Eastern America. The elevated vantage point provided breathtaking panoramic views of the mist-enshrouded mountains. As we stood atop its iconic observation tower, it felt like we were touching the sky, truly experiencing the grandeur that the East has to offer. This majestic start set the tone for our continued exploration.Following our time at Clingmans Dome, we ventured to Gatlinburg to sample the local wines and whiskies. This was a novel experience for us, allowing us to immerse ourselves in the rich flavors and traditions of the region. The tastings not only introduced us to new flavors but also deepened our appreciation for Gatlinburg's vibrant culinary scene.

On Wednesday, considering the diverse interests of our group of five families and varying ages of the kids, we chose to divide and conquer. Some of us, accompanied by the teenagers, sought the thrill of ziplining. Meanwhile, the other group ventured to Gatlinburg to experience the allure of the longest pedestrian skybridge, complemented by the skylift, skydeck, and its captivating skytrail. This approach ensured everyone had a day tailored to their interests and energy levels.

On Thursday, the rain made its presence known, urging us to explore indoor activities. That's when we serendipitously stumbled upon the Tuckaleechee Caverns. This unexpected find became, for me, the most wondrous highlight of our Smoky Mountain trip. Instead of embarking on a long trail, we conveniently drove up to the entrance, purchased tickets for around $20, and were soon led into the cave by an experienced guide.

The tour, lasting about an hour and a half, was awe-inspiring. Tuckaleechee Caverns, situated in Townsend, TN, and often hailed as the “Greatest Site Under the Smokies,” boasts the highest rating for any cave or cavern in the Eastern United States. Its breathtaking underground waterfall plummets a staggering 210 feet, earning it the distinction of being the tallest subterranean waterfall in the Eastern US. The 1.25-mile round trip journey presented us with millions of intricate formations, further solidifying the caverns as a must-visit gem of the region.

On Friday, it was time to bid farewell to our Smoky Mountain retreat. We checked out of our accommodations and began our journey back home, carrying with us a trove of cherished memories.
