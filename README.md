I made the decision to share my blog posts on GitHub using Jekyll, and it has proven to be an excellent choice. Jekyll is a static site generator that offers a multitude of benefits for hosting a blog. One of the main reasons I chose Jekyll is its simplicity and ease of use. With Jekyll, I can focus on writing content without getting caught up in complex configurations or dependencies. The straightforward structure and intuitive templating system allow me to create and customize my blog effortlessly. Additionally, Jekyll's integration with GitHub Pages makes it seamless to publish my blog directly from my repository. This combination of simplicity, flexibility, and seamless integration convinced me that Jekyll was the perfect tool for my blogging needs. Now, I can confidently share my thoughts and stories with the world through my GitHub-hosted Jekyll blog.
